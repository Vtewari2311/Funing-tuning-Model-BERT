# Funing-tuning-Model-BERT
We will fine-tune a BERT model for text classification. We make use of at least two different BERT fine-tuning models. I have chosen to train multiple models based on a given dataset and a smaller dataset from two separate models differing in architecture, number of examples and BERTâ€™s cased vs uncased.
